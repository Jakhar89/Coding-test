# UI Generators

Create every kind of support structure easily with generators.

## Installing FileVault

FileVault (VLT) can be used to sync the generated content automatically which reduces the amount of time it takes to push new/updated support structures into AEM. Installing FileVault is easy on macOS and can be done so via Homebrew using Adobe's tap.

```bash
brew tap adobe-marketing-cloud/brews
brew install adobe-marketing-cloud/brews/filevault
```
